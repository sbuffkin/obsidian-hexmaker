## Drawing tools

### Road / River
Paint a connected chain of road or river hexes. Left-click hexes to extend the chain; right-click a hex already in the chain to remove it. Each chain is drawn as a colored line connecting adjacent hexes.

### Terrain
Opens the terrain palette. Select a color/icon to enter paint mode, then left-click hexes to apply that terrain. Use **Pick** (⌖) to sample terrain from an existing hex. Use **Clear** to erase terrain from hexes. Right-click the terrain button to open the palette editor where you can reorder, rename, recolor, and add terrain types.

### Icon
Opens the icon palette. Select an icon to enter paint mode, then left-click hexes to apply a custom icon override (independent of the terrain icon). Useful for marking notable locations.

### Link table
Opens a folder-tree picker scoped to your Tables folder. Select a random-encounter table, then left-click hexes to link that table into each hex's **Encounters Table** section.

### Link faction
Opens a folder-tree picker scoped to your Factions folder. Select a faction note, then left-click hexes to link it into each hex's **Factions** section.

### Swap
Swap the contents of two hex positions by renaming their files.

1. **Select** the first hex — highlighted amber (source)
2. **Select** a second hex — highlighted purple (destination)
3. **Select the destination again** to confirm the swap

Selecting the source hex again cancels the selection. Selecting a different hex while a destination is already highlighted changes the destination.
