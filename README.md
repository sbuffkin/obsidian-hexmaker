# Hexmaker

An Obsidian plugin for tabletop RPG hex-map world-building. Each hex on the map corresponds to a Markdown note in your vault, letting you attach terrain, locations, and prose directly to the geography of your world.

---

## Manual Installation

1. Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` from the [latest release](https://github.com/sbuffkin/obsidian-hexmaker/releases/latest).
2. In your vault, create the folder `.obsidian/plugins/hexmaker-plugin/`.
3. Copy the three downloaded files into that folder.
4. In Obsidian, open **Settings → Community plugins**, find **Hexmaker** in the list, and enable it.

---

## Getting started

After enabling the plugin, do this once before you start mapping:

### 1. Set your world folder
Open **Settings → Hexmaker** and enter a root folder name in **World folder** (e.g. `RPG/world`). This is the base for all other folders.

### 2. Generate folders
Click **Generate folders**. This fills in the hex, towns, dungeons, tables, and other folder settings with sensible defaults under your world folder and creates them in your vault. Any field you've already filled in is left untouched.

### 3. Open the Hex Map
Click the map icon in the left ribbon (or use the command palette: **Open Hexmaker hex map**). You'll be prompted to create your first region — give it a name, choose its size, and pick a terrain palette.

### 4. Generate terrain tables
Once your folders are set, go back to **Settings → Hexmaker** and click **Generate terrain tables & hex links**. This creates a description and encounters table file for every terrain type and links them into any existing hex notes. It's safe to run again at any time.

You're ready to start mapping.

## Features

### Hex Map view
An interactive hex grid rendered as an Obsidian panel.

- **Left-click** a hex to open (or create) its note.
- **Right-click** a hex to open the hex editor.
- **Pan** by clicking and dragging with the left or middle mouse button.
- **Zoom** with the scroll wheel.
- **Expand** the grid with the `+`/`−` buttons in the toolbar.
- **Go to hex** (`⌖` button) — enter coordinates to centre the view on a specific hex.

### Regions
The map is divided into named regions, each stored as a subfolder under your hex folder. Switch, create, rename, and delete regions from the region button in the toolbar.

Each region is assigned a **terrain palette** at creation time (see below).

### Hex editor (right-click menu)
A side-panel modal for editing a hex note without leaving the map.

- **Terrain picker** — select the terrain type for the hex from the region's palette.
- **Icon override** — override the default terrain icon with any icon in your icons folder.
- **Towns / Dungeons** — link existing notes from their configured folders, or create a new note by name. Linked items are clickable and open in a new tab. Each entry has a remove button.
- **Features** — free-form wiki-link list for anything else.
- **Encounters Table** — link random table files to a hex. Clicking a linked table opens the Random Tables view with that table pre-selected.
- **Notes sections** — Description, Landmark, Hidden, Secret, Encounters, Weather, Hooks & Rumors — inline text areas with a 🎲 roll button to append a result from any random table.
- **Open note** link next to the hex coordinates opens the full note in a new tab.

### Random Tables view
Open via **Command palette → "Open Hexmaker random tables"** or the 🎲 toolbar button on the hex map.

A two-panel view for managing and rolling on random tables.

- **Left panel** — lists all `.md` files in the configured Tables folder. Click a table to load it. **+ New** creates a file from the default template.
- **Right panel** — shows the table's entries with odds (percentage or die range). **Roll** button highlights the winning row and shows the result. The result is editable before use. Roll history shows the last 5 results.
- **Change die** dropdown — updates the `dice:` frontmatter and recalculates die ranges.

### Workflows view
Open via the Workflows tab in the Random Tables panel.

Chain multiple table rolls together into a filled template note.

- **Create a workflow** — define steps (each step rolls a table N times), a template with `$placeholder` variables, and a results folder.
- **Roll a workflow** — each step shows a dropdown and a Roll button. The template fills in live as you roll. Save the result as a new vault note.

### Terrain tables & hex linking
Each terrain type has two auto-generated table files: `{terrain} - description.md` and `{terrain} - encounters.md`, stored under `{tablesFolder}/terrain/`.

> ⚠️ **Configure all folder settings before clicking Generate.** The Generate button (Settings → Hexmaker → Generate world data) creates the terrain table files and links each hex note's terrain encounters table into its Encounters Table section. It is safe to run multiple times.

### Drawing tools (toolbar)
Toggle tools from the toolbar above the map. **Right-click** off a hex to exit any tool.

| Tool | Left-click | Right-click (on hex) |
|------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Terrain** | Paint terrain on a hex (drag to paint multiple) | — |
| **Icon** | Paint an icon override on a hex | — |
| **Road** | Add hex to road chain | Remove hex from road |
| **River** | Add hex to river chain | Remove hex from river |

**Terrain painter extras:**
- Clicking the Terrain button always reopens the palette so you can switch colours mid-session.
- **Pick** (eyedropper) — samples the terrain from the next hex you click and sets it as the active brush.
- **Clear** — paints the "no terrain" state.
- **Brush size** — paint 1×, 3×, or 7× hex radius at once.

Roads and rivers are drawn as connected chains; adjacent chain hexes are joined by a coloured line. Road/river colours are configurable in Settings.

### Hex table view
Open via **Command palette → "Open Hexmaker hex table"**.

A scrollable reference table of every hex note, with one row per hex and columns for all sections.

- **Coordinates column** — click to open the hex note.
- **Terrain column** — click to open the terrain picker.
- **Town / Dungeon columns** — click an empty cell to add a link (pick existing or create new); click a populated cell to open the note (or a navigation list for multiple links).
- **Text section columns** (Description, Landmark, etc.) — click any cell (including empty ones) to open an inline editor. Saves directly to the section in the hex note, creating the note and section if they don't exist yet.
- **Resize columns** by dragging the border between column headers.
- **Refresh** button reloads all data from disk.

## Hex notes

Each hex note lives at `{hexFolder}/{region}/{x}_{y}.md` (e.g. `RPG/world/hexes/Overworld/3_7.md`).

**Frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
terrain: Forest
---
```

**Sections** (used by the editor and table view):

| Heading | Type | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| `### description` | Text | What the party sees and feels |
| `### landmark` | Text | The standout visible feature |
| `### Towns` | Links | Settlement links |
| `### Dungeons` | Links | Dungeon/site links |
| `### Features` | Links | Other points of interest |
| `### Encounters Table` | Links | Random table links (linked to terrain by Generate) |
| `### hidden` | Text | Discoverable with effort |
| `### secret` | Text | Revealed only through investigation |
| `### encounters` | Text | Encounter table notes |
| `### weather` | Text | Weather notes |
| `### hooks & rumors` | Text | Adventure seeds |

You can use your own template (configured in Settings). Any `### Heading` that matches a section name will be picked up automatically.

## Development

```bash
npm install        # install dependencies
npm run dev        # watch mode — rebuilds main.js on every save
npm run build      # production build (type-check + bundle)
npm run version    # bump version (updates manifest.json and versions.json)
npm test           # run the test suite
```

The built output is `main.js` in the repo root. Obsidian loads this file directly from the plugin folder.

**Reload the plugin after a build:**
```js
// Paste in Obsidian developer console (Ctrl+Shift+I)
app.plugins.disablePlugin('hexmaker-plugin');
app.plugins.enablePlugin('hexmaker-plugin');
```
